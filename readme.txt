Usage of PK function:

Change the working directory for MATLAB to match the directory that the PK file is in.

The function can be utilized using the following command:

PK('rho',[IPts])

where rho is a string representing the reactivity insertion (ex. '0.0065' or '0.0065*t')
where IPts is a vector representing the time interest points (in seconds) for the simulation
